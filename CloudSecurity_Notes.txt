Encrpt sensitive data in S3 usin SSE 

//Encrypt data at rest 
    require kms keys:
        s3 bucks, RDS/Aurora DB, EC2 EBS
// Ecrypt data in transit
    use HTTPS everywhere:
        https in s3
        cloudfront /aws certificate manaer
    DB:
        require ssl/tls conn.

shared security controls

    Acitive directory or LDAP with AWS Conginto to federate username
